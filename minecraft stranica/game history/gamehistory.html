      Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game
      developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson
      in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing
      versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in
      November 2011, with Jens Bergensten then taking over development.
      Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the
      best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and
      nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.
