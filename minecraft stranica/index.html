    <h1 class="first">Simple explanation</h1>
    <p class="first">
      In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world
      with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw
      materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks.
      Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as
      well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.
      Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire
      resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode,
      where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. Players can
      modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.

    <h2 class="second">Gameplay</h2>
    <p class="second">
      Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish,
      allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the
      game. However, there is an achievement system, known as "advancements" in
      the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports.
      Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have
      the option for third-person perspective. The game world is composed of
      rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called
      "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree
      trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and
      placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while
      players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and
      then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many
      commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic. The
      game also contains a material known as redstone, which can be used to make
      primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates,
      allowing for the construction of many complex systems.
